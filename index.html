  <h1>My Frist Github Repository. I love Github so far and always will</h1>
  <h2>My day is going good so far. I'm planning on asking my friend if he is busy later, to see if he wants to play on the game with me (Xbox/PS4) because I really want to level up as much as I can in the game I'm playing. 
    Also I might go to the moives this weekend with my best friend, we haven't planed on a moive to see yet but we will most likely decide the day before.</h2>
